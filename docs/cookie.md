Cookies are created by a web server while a user is browsing a website.

## Where

Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website, and more than one cookie may be placed on a userâ€™s device during a session.

## How

Cookies are set using the Set-Cookie header field, sent in an HTTP response from the web server. 

As an example, the browser sends its first HTTP request for the homepage of the www.example.org website:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
...
```

The server responds with two Set-Cookie header fields:

```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
...
```
